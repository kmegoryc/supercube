    title: Why Supercube™?
    content: >-
      The extended use of personal protective equipment puts workers at risk. We
      hear stories of nurses cleaning their masks with bleach or harmful
      chemicals and were determined to find a better solution. **UVC inactivates
      viruses quickly with no harmful chemicals**, but you must achieve full
      coverage at the proper dosage. Supercube's rotating carousel design
      ensures even coverage and proper exposure for every mask. 


      **In just a** **few minutes** you can **decontaminate up to 32 masks**, close to point-of-care, with no additional equipment or chemicals. Supercube is **simple to operate and is priced at a fraction of the cost of similar units**. We want to make Supercube accessible to everyone. Whether you are a firefighter in rural Nebraska or a critical care nurse in New York City, you deserve safe and effective PPE.

    title: Why UV-C?
    section_id: uvc
    content: UV germicidal wavelength damages the genetic material in the cell
      nucleus of bacteria, viruses, and molds. Cells are rendered unable to
      reproduce thus inactivating the microorganism. At the same time, UVC
      enacts minimal damage to PPE, allowing you to extend use in crisis
      situations.
