    content: >-
      Hospitals all over the world are rapidly using and disposing of masks that
      they cannot reuse during a global pandemic. Masks are our most valuable
      asset during this time, and can mean the difference between life and death
      for our frontline doctors and hospital staff.


      Supercube offers an effective and proven mask reuse solution for hospitals. This unit utilizes an ultraviolet wavelength, UV-C, that has been test-proven to completely eradicate COVID-19. Hospitals can help keep their vulnerable staff and patients safe from contracting or spreading COVID-19.
