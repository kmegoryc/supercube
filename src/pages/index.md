    title: Why UV-C?
    section_id: uvc
    content: UV germicidal wavelength damages the genetic material in the cell
      nucleus of bacteria, viruses, and molds. Cells are rendered unable to
      reproduce thus inactivating the microorganism. At the same time, UVC
      enacts minimal damage to PPE, allowing you to extend use in crisis
      situations.
